Title:  Music guessing game

Developers:  Corey DeCato, Amy McLaughlin, Dave Runnals

We propose developing a musical guessing game.  The user would be required to input the genre of music they wish to explore.  Optionally they would enter a date range by year and/or an artist.  A multiple choice quiz would pop up with a randomly generated animated GIF that would run while the user guesses the correct answer.  If the user guesses correctly, a YouTube video of the artist pops up.  If the user guesses incorrectly, a sad GIF pops up.

At the end of the game, a list of the correct artists pops up.  We would link it to Spotify facts about the artist including a list of their available music.   The user can choose to replay the full YouTube video.

What problems does the user have?

User can’t find new music/artists
User is looking to challenge their existing musical knowledge
User wants to focus on mindful listening
